# AI for Market Trend Analysis  
### Stock Trend Prediction using NVIDIA (NVDA)

## Overview
This project applies basic machine learning techniques to analyze historical stock price data and predict short-term market trends. Using daily price data of NVIDIA (NVDA) over the last five years, a supervised learning model is trained to classify whether the stock price will move upward or downward on the next trading day.

The primary goal of this project is educational: to demonstrate how AI techniques can be applied to market trend analysis using publicly available data.
